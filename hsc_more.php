                    <p>Instead of doing sessions one-on-one saturate yourself in the supportive, concentrated focus of group energy and processing. Hold yourself in the positive energy of what you want - long enough to create your new patterns effectively.</p>

                    <p>The Group Rapid Eye Intensive Program is unlike anything you have ever experienced, even if you have already done Rapid Eye Technology individual sessions.</p>

                    <p>We address the habitual relative thought, affects or behaviors that are present in mankind, as the focus of this group is to identify and release these limiting thoughts.</p>

                    <p>In my opinion, the ability to release unhealthy feelings like anger, fear, anxiety, addictions, sabotage, depression, lack and failure that may show up in family life is beyond magnificent! </p>

                    <p>Most every family has experienced a less than positive crisis, event, activity or trauma at one point in time or another. Imagine clearing the feelings it brought on to each family member. Each person can have their own perspective and feelings about any and all experiences and know that we expect the perceptions to be different. They will all clear beautifully just the same.</p>

                    <p>The endless possibilities to heal whatever is your family experience. Heal together - begin again, cleansed and cleared of feelings and emotions that block you off from the closeness you want back. Clear the layers of feelings so that you can feel the love you have for yourself and one another.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes you haven't had the opportunity to be close and know that it is never too late. Create the closeness that is the hope within your heart for you and your family. If you are willing to do the work -- you will have the result of warmth, closeness and pure joy. Now I would imagine you will read this and think, "This just sounds too simply." It is. It takes intention and showing up.</p>  

                    <p>Common place community groups of like-minded people are everywhere. These are set up as topic or issue support groups. There are plenty of them specific to men or to women who have a desire for companionship so that they can share similar experiences.</p>

                    <p>While sharing relatable experiences people often form a 2nd family, so to speak. Often these groups have a focus which is common enough to interest people in numbers. They may meet on a regular basis, yet sometimes the group feels stuck. The Rapid Eye Technology group sessions can assist them to release the thinking and feelings, so that they can move forward in their group focus. We would be happy to hear from them then meet and discuss how RET can be a fit.</p>

                    <p>Speak to your family, local church group, caregivers, resource centre and other neighborhood gatherings that you are a part of, because change is needed.</p>

                       <p>Inner Child Development is a journey to bring together neglected and forgotten parts of your life's experience. The healing of your wounded Inner- Child allows us to release the past.</p>

                <h1>Integrated Energy Technology, (IET) Overview</h1>
<p>As we journey in our lives the flow of energy can become restricted or limited. You can think of the energy pathways as being like riverbeds that become choked by a beaver dam. The dam does not stop the flow, but rather, it limits the flow and creates an area of energy stagnation. These restrictions are commonly referred to as energy blockages. Some causes of energy blockages are physical trauma, surgery, disease, exhaustion, starvation, emotional crises, suppressed feelings, stress, fear, self-limiting thoughts and karma. Energy blockages limit our experiences of life and can result in lack of spontaneity, energy depletion even disease. 
Integrated Energy Therapy helps you to safely and gently release limiting energy patterns from your past, empower and balance your life in the present, and embody your full potential as you move into your future.</p>

Integrated Energy Technology Practitioner, Deborah Chester
Integrated Energy Therapy is ideal for clients wanting to begin an energy therapy healing experience. The Rapid Eye Technology and Reiki energy training and practice, provides a wonderful complement to IET. Though each is a perfect standalone energy therapy system, it is ideal to integrate all three modalities and occurs quite organically as the practitioner intuitively blends the energies while working with her clients. So be it Rapid Eye, Reiki or IET sessions the modalities integrate the techniques of each holistic modality which adds to and creates a special delivery of healing and each Holistic Practitioner becomes unique in their delivery.</p>

                      <h1> Holy Fire Definition</h1>
            <p><quote>"The use of the word "holy"</quote> in the name Holy Fire is not intended to have a religious meaning. The word holy has as its root meaning, to be whole and complete, and this is how it is used in Holy Fire Reiki. Therefore, Holy Fire Reiki is a spiritual energy that creates wholeness through purification, healing, empowerment and guidance.</p>
            <h1>Benefits</h1>
            <p>Reiki energy allows muscles to relax and increases blood flow to treated areas, which in turn quickens the healing process. Practitioners and clients report help with stress, headaches, insomnia, upset stomach, sprains, and other minor conditions. Occasionally, miraculous results are reported. </p>
            <p>Reiki also promotes psychological healing, including release of anger, fear, worry, sadness, and other unhealthy feelings and replaces them with self-worth, confidence and tranquility.</p>

            <h1>Reiki Training Classes</h1>
            <h2>There are four levels of Reiki available for learning and here is a simplified summary:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li> <p><strong>Level One</strong></p> <p>(Shoden) Beginner teachings; developing spiritual and mental focus; techniques and meditations; hands on healing.</p>
            <p>In short teaches the history of Reiki and prepares the student to treat plants, animals and oneself with Reiki. The certified class length is one full day of instruction. There are ignitions and placements. When the student completes their first level they may attend Reiki Shares. </p>
            </li>
             <li> <p><strong>Level Two</strong></p><p> (Okuden) hidden or inner teachings; continued spiritual and mental focus; continued techniques and meditations; introduction of mantras and three symbols. </p>
            <p>In short, teaches the student how to apply Reiki on another person and become a Certified Reiki Practitioner. The student learns sacred symbols, receives ignitions and placements and practices Reiki on a classmate. 
            In addition the student is now prepared to provide Reiki Sessions as a Reiki Practitioner. Students receive business practice forms and training on how to use them. The length of time for the certification is two full days of training. </p> 
            </li>
             <li> <p><strong>Level Three</strong></p><p> (Shinpiden) mystery teachings; continued spiritual and mental focus; continued techniques and meditations; mantras and one additional symbol. Also, student will receive ignitions and placements.
            In short, is a Certified Advanced Reiki Training (ART);  ART is generally taught at the time the mature Reiki Practitioner is ready and interested in the advanced Reiki Program. This level can also be taught when the client is ready to complete their Level Four or Usui Reiki Master Level.</p>
            <p>However, not all students wish to be Reiki Masters/Teachers. They still may take the Advanced Level Three Training as a next Level and receive Certified Level Three Status on its own merits. This training takes two days to complete. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p> <strong>Level Four</strong></p><p> in short includes a three day training to become a Certified Reiki Master/Teacher. The Master Level includes ignitions and placements, learning the Master Sacred symbols. At this level the Master Reiki Practitioner begins their Master Practitioner journey. They may train other students to successfully complete each Level of the Reiki Certifications. </p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>All Levels include a Text Manual, Certificate and misc. documents with a body Chart.</h2>
